# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a player vs. computer mode, where the player uses "X" and the computer uses "O". The game also tracks the score of both the player and the computer.

## Features

- **Player vs. Computer:** Play against the computer in this classic game.
- **Score Tracking:** The score for both the player and the computer is tracked and displayed.
- **Reset Functionality:** After each game, you can reset and start a new one.
- **Alternate Starts:** Each game alternates who starts, ensuring fairness by toggling the first move between the player and the computer.

## Gameplay

1. The player always starts first and places an "X" on the grid.
2. The computer will respond by placing an "O" on a random empty square.
3. The game continues until either the player or the computer wins, or the game ends in a draw.
4. After the game ends, a "Play Again" button will appear, allowing you to reset the game and start a new round.

## Algorithm

The computer's moves are determined by a random algorithm and do not use any Tic-Tac-Toe strategies.
